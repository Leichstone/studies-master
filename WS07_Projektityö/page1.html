            <p>
                Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing video game developed and published by Larian Studios. It is the third
                main game in the Baldur's Gate series,
                based on the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing system. The game was released in early access in
                October 2020, with a full release planned
                for August 2023. Set in the Forgotten Realms universe - the universe known from D&D -, the game features
                both single-player and multiplayer modes,
                allowing players to create their own characters or choose from pre-made ones to embark on an epic
                adventure filled with exploration, combat, and decision-making.
                <br><br>
                Larian's previous game Divinity: Original Sin II greatly influenced Baldur's Gate 3, as it adopted many
                of its gameplay mechanics and design philosophies,
                but they are vastly different. The lack of ground effects in BG3 is a notable change from Divinity:
                Original Sin II, as the latter heavily relied on environmental
                interactions for builds, while Baldur's Gate 3 uses a more traditional approach to combat and character
                progression, focusing on the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset.

            <p>
                There were rumours around regarding a new Larian Studios game in the works, and it has now been confirmed
                to be another game in the <strong>Divinity</strong> franchise. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w">Source</a>
                for the trailer can be found there, and I am very excited to see what Larian has in store for us next!

            <p>As you can see, the games have a striking resemblence. Anyone a fan of one of them should enjoy the other
                one as well. The gif above shows off the different character creation screens in the two games.
                In the following list, I will be jotting down some notes about different character builds I would like
                to try out in my next run.
            </p>
            <h2>Build ideas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleric (Trickery Domain):</strong> A support-focused build that excels in illusion based
                    buffs and debuffing the enemies, while also dealing decent damage with Radiant spells, such as <span
                        class="color-radiant">Guiding Bolt</span> and <span class="color-radiant">Spirit
                        Guardians</span>. The Light Domain is very solid for carrying
                    runs as well, especially with its strong burst of Radiant damage, and the utility of being hit a
                    little less often.</li>
                <li><strong>Rogue (Assassin):</strong> A stealthy and agile build that specializes in pickpocketing,
                    lockpicking, and dealing high damage with sneak attacks right at the start of combat with guaranteed
                    <span class="color-critical">critical hits</span>. I love Assassin for its heavy-hitting attacks. 
                    Swashbuckler is a strong alternative which is extremely fun to play and has wonderful utility which 
                    can be used each turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Wizard (Bladesinging):</strong> A spellcasting build that focuses on dealing high and consistent 
                    damage with physical attacks, boosting one of the highest Armor Class values, especially for a spellcaster. 
                    The Bladesinger subclass allows for a mix of melee and ranged combat, where you are able to spend your 
                    slots freely on utility and control, or massive area-of-effect damage with evocation spells, such as 
                    <span class="color-thunder">Shatter</span>, <span class="color-lightning">Lightning Bolt</span>, 
                    <span class="color-fire">Fireball</span>, and <span class="color-fire">Wall of Fire</span>. This build 
                    would be perfect for players who enjoy a more offensive playstyle, as well as a focus on spellcasting 
                    and magical abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Fighter (Arcane Archer) / Barbarian (Giant):</strong> A straightforward and durable build that 
                    excels in melee combat with a two-handed weapon, utilizing the Great-Weapon Master (GWM) feat, allowing 
                    for huge bursts of consistent damage every turn. The Arcane Archer subclass provides additional ranged 
                    options and magical effects, while the Giant subclass increases overall survivability.
                    This build would be great for players who enjoy a more tank-like role, as well as a focus on physical 
                    combat and weapon mastery.</li>
                <li><strong>Final notes:</strong> It's good to have your main character, usually referred to as "Tav", have
                    decent Charisma and skills supporting that Ability Score as well. I much prefer to control one character
                    around the map without having to swap to a different character just to talk to someone. That aside, the
                    other classes I have been interested in would be Druid, Ranger, and Bard, as I have yet to properly
                    play those classes to their fullest.</li>
